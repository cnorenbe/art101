					<p>Hi, this is Coralie Norenberg and my partner Stephanie Lipe! 
						My partner Stephanie likes making art, reading, watching good 
						shows and movies, listening to music, and learning about things 
						like history. She’s an art and literature major so that all makes
						sense. Stephanie thinks that life should be a constant state of 
						learning, but she also loves idle activities like hanging out with 
						friends or going for a walk along the beach. She thinks those moments 
						are equally as valuable. I like to swim, run, make art (I’m an art major),
						hang out with my roommates, listen to music, and eat good food! I 
						agree with my partner, I don’t think learning ever stops in life, 
						we can learn from everything and everyone around us. I try to uphold
						this by being outgoing and a good listener!
						We're both very excited to learn more about coding!</p>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we were challenged to create basic HTML and CSS files to edit and then view in our browsers!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble following along in class because of the fast speed and on canvas because not everything is pictured. I stayed patient and referred to my partner when I was stuck and we worked through it together.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was fun! It was cool to get to design what the webpage looked like making me want to put more and more creative energy into what I was making. I am proud of how it turned out! </p>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> as pictured!</p>
