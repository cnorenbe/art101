					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were challenged to create a local file structure within ART101, add images 
						and index.html files, and upload it to the server to create a working homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't figure out how to resize my image so I continued to placd the 
						esizing code in css and the html link and eventually it worked! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The results of this lab customized my homepage even more and provided me with how 
						to place images. I feel ready to solve more problems that are bound to come up after this!
