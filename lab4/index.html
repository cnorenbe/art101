			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Starting to think about pseudocoding before we start actually coding!s</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any big issues with this assignment, I feel that the instructions given on canvas and in class were super clear! I do get confused with structure and formatting and I feel like I might've messed up on this a little :/</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like this assignment might have been my favorite! It was fun to break something down into parts and organize it. JavaScript seemed intimidating at first, but knowing a different coding language first made it easier. I put a normal amount of effort, I think since I had more fun with it I was putting in more genuine effort but I did not put any extreme effort.</p>

						1. Gather Supplies
						1.1. Gardening gloves
						1.2. Trowel
						1.3. Rake
						1.4. Seeds or seedlings (vegetables, flowers, etc.)
						1.5. Compost or fertilizer
						1.6. Watering can or hose
						
						2. Choose a Location
						2.1. Find a sunny spot in your yard or balcony
						2.2. Ensure the area has good drainage
						
						3. Prepare the Soil
						3.1. Remove any weeds or debris from the area.
						3.2. Use a rake to level the soil.
						3.3. Mix in compost or fertilizer to enrich the soil.
						
						4. Plant the Seeds/Seedlings
						4.1. Dig holes according to seed/seedling instructions.
						4.2. Place seeds or seedlings in the holes.
						4.3. Cover with soil and gently pat down.
						
						5. Water the Garden
						5.1. Use a watering can or hose to gently water the newly planted area.
						5.2. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
						
						6. Monitor and Maintain
						6.1. Water regularly, depending on plant needs.
						6.2. Check for weeds and remove them.
						6.3. Look for pests or diseases and take action as needed.

					<h2>OUTLINE FOR HOW TO START A GARDEN:</h2>
					<p>
						1. Initialize Game
						1.1. Create a deck of cards (e.g., cards = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]).
						1.2. Shuffle the deck.
						1.3. Set up score variable (e.g., playerScore = 0).
						1.4. Set up an empty board to represent the cards (e.g., board = [_, _, _, _, _, _, _, _]).

						2. Start Game Loop
						2.1. Display the current board state.
						2.2. Display the player's score.

						3. Player's Turn
						3.1. Prompt player to select the first card (e.g., firstChoice).
						3.2. Validate the choice (e.g., check if the card is already revealed).
						3.3. Reveal the first card on the board.
						3.4. Prompt player to select the second card (e.g., secondChoice).
						3.5. Validate the choice.
						3.6. Reveal the second card on the board.

						4. Check for Match
						4.1. Compare the two revealed cards.
						4.1.1. If they match, increment playerScore and leave them revealed.
						4.1.2. If they don't match, hide the cards again after a brief pause.

						5. Check for Game Over
						5.1. Determine if all pairs have been matched.
						5.2. If all pairs are matched, end the game.
