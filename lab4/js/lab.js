// 1. Initialize Game
    // Create a deck of cards (e.g., cards = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4])
    // Shuffle the deck
    // Set up score variable (e.g., playerScore = 0)
    // Set up an empty board to represent the cards (e.g., board = [_, _, _, _, _, _, _, _])

// 2. Start Game Loop
    // Display the current board state
    // Display the player’s score

// 3. Player's Turn
    // Prompt player to select the first card (e.g., firstChoice)
    // Validate the choice (e.g., check if the card is already revealed)
    // Reveal the first card on the board
    // Prompt player to select the second card (e.g., secondChoice)
    // Validate the choice
    // Reveal the second card on the board

// 4. Check for Match
    // Compare the two revealed cards
        // If they match, increment playerScore and leave them revealed
        // If they don’t match, hide the cards again after a brief pause

// 5. Check for Game Over
    // Determine if all pairs have been matched
    // If all pairs are matched, end the game

// 6. End Game
    // Display final score
    // Announce the player's performance (e.g., number of moves or time taken)
    // Ask if the player wants to play again
        // If "yes," return to Step 1
        // If "no," exit the game

// let's get this party started
main();
