					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>Hi! I'm Coralie and I am an art major taking this class as a GE! So far coding is getting the best of me :/ 
						Other than classes I love craeting art, running, swimming in the ocean, listening to music and hanging out with friends! 
						I find it very hard to be doing nothing so my days are always busy. I work in creative marketing for the school's athletics 
						and recreation department, this has turned into something I want to pursue after college as well. 
						My dream is to live in a big city like New York or SF :)</p>
